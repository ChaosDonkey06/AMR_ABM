## Information

This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the analysis in the original manuscript entitled *Dynamic Modeling of Antimicrobial Resistant Organisms: Estimation of Community Prevalence and Nosocomial Transmission*  by the authors listed above. In particular the code contains an agent based model within an Iterated Filtering framework to estimate importation rates and nosocomial contact rates using patient movement between hospital facility wards, admissions and discharge.

## Packages
In the directory code there's a file with the packages and versions used for this manuscript. Follow the steps below installing a conda environment and replicating all the results.

## Replicating the paper
We provide Jupyter notebooks to replicate what would you need to create the Figure in the main manuscript. They follow the names FigureX.ipynb for x $\in [1,\text{Number of Figures}]$. Aditionally we provide examples on how to use the agent based model and the basic structure of the data use to track the movement of the patients.

## Contact
Please reach if you have any question regards the modeling or the inference algorithm. We provide an anonymized data to replicate the resutls but for some Figures it might not be sufficient to repliate it. Any correspondence should be sent to jc56470@cumc.columbia.edu
